# UserProfileSdk

A demo example application to showcase build-aware SDK builders for intelligent Android SDK (library)Â design.

## Background

So, you're building an Android SDK (library). And of course, you're going to integrate the library inside a sample application before publishing in order to test it thoroughly and use as a demo for Product and Sales team members. As you develop it, you are bound to have Debug build variant features that you definitely do not want to ship in Production code.

**Let's start off with a thesis**:
> Testing / Debug code should never be included in shipped Production code.
